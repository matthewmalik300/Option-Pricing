🧮 Monte Carlo Option Pricing

This project demonstrates a Monte Carlo simulation approach for pricing European call options, comparing it against the Black-Scholes closed-form solution.

🔍 Key Features

Implements Monte Carlo simulations to estimate option prices

Includes Black-Scholes benchmark for validation

Uses NumPy and SciPy for numerical methods

Plots convergence and pricing accuracy with Matplotlib

📈 Topics Covered

Random walk simulation of asset prices under geometric Brownian motion

Black-Scholes formula implementation

Convergence analysis of simulation vs analytical pricing

Option Greeks calculation (e.g., Delta)
